Hi,I AM  Asha, and I am a Data Scientist with 3.8 years of experience, and I am currently working at AIML Labs. I have done data science, end-to-end projects. I have good knowledge/skill of Python programming.
As a Data Scientist, I have hands-on experience with a wide range of ML  algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, KNN, and K-means. I have applied these algorithms to solve regression, classification, and clustering-related problems effectively.
In terms of programming, I am proficient in Python and have worked extensively with libraries such as:
NumPy,Pandas,Scikit-learn,NLTK,Matplotlib,Seaborn, Keras & TensorFlow
One of my notable accomplishments includes developing and training machine learning models for chatbot dialog generation, where I leveraged NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis. Additionally, I integrated the chatbot with external APIs and implemented end-to-end pipelines for seamless deployment.
My expertise also extends to data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.
This is about my professional information.
